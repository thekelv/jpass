Jpass - Random Password Generator (c)2000 Kelv <kelv@kelv.net> / http://www.kelv.net

v1.0
----
I needed a password generator to add passwords to the signup form of a php/mysql based admin 
system, and here is the result of my programming effort. The passwords are fairly easily 
pronounced and quite random.

v1.1
----
Fixed variable name bug which stopped Jpass working in Netscape Navigator. Tested in 4.6.
