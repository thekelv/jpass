Jpass - Random Password Generator 

Demo
----
https://www.kelv.net/programming/jpass.php

Usage
-----
```
let j = new Jpass();
console.log(j.generate());
```

v1.0
----
I needed a password generator to add passwords to the signup form of a php/mysql based admin 
system, and here is the result of my programming effort. The passwords are fairly easily 
pronounced and quite random.

v1.1
----
Fixed variable name bug which stopped Jpass working in Netscape Navigator. Tested in 4.6.

v1.2
----
Refactored into generic plugin.
